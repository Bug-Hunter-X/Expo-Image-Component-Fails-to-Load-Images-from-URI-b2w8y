# Expo Image Component URI Loading Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the Expo `Image` component with URIs: failure to load images due to various reasons such as incorrect URI formatting, network problems, or inaccessible image sources.

## Bug Description
The `Image` component fails to display images when provided with URIs that are malformed, point to non-existent resources, or encounter network errors. This leads to a blank area on the screen where the image should be. The console may or may not provide further error details.

## Solution
The solution involves carefully verifying the URI's accuracy, checking for network connectivity, ensuring the image server is functioning correctly, and implementing error handling within the component.
