This error occurs when using the Expo `Image` component with a URI that's not properly formatted or accessible.  It can manifest as a blank space where the image should be or a generic error message in the console. The root cause is often an incorrect URI, network issues, or problems with the image source itself. This is not a typical Expo-specific bug, but a common issue related to image loading in any JavaScript framework.
